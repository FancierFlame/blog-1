				<h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize"> i had visited in december 2018</h5>
				<p class="text-muted text-left"> Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep and happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

				<p class="text-muted text-left"> It's a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Must haired tour guide so it will be batter to under stand all the things. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It's a historical site famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago</p>

				<p class="text-muted text-left">One of the oldest Monastery in Darjeeling. It is situated in peaceful and beautiful landscape just 15 minutes walk from Ghoom Railway Station. We can see religious God and Goddess paintings believed by Buddhism inside which can give spiritual power to one who prays there with clean heart. From the compound of Monastery on a clear day one can have a scenery of hills all around which is great for nature lovers. </p>

					Saw it today with my kids and they loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you’ll miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity War Civil War Black Panther Age of ultron Ant Man and the Wasp Problem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must
					go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

					2019’s The Lion King is a ‘live action’ remake of the 1994 original animation flick which went on to become an iconic film for all ages. Those who have watched the original Lion King will vouch for its strong emotional connect, rousing, heartbreaking moments that left a lasting impression and of course the legendary soundtrack and background score.

					So does the 2019 version of Lion King match up? (In India, the film is releasing in four languages – English and also dubbed in Hindi, Tamil and Telegu.) The big draw of course of the Hindi dubbed version is actor Shah Rukh Khan as Mufasa and Aryan Khan as Simba. The father and son duo had earlier lent their voices to the Hindi dubbed version of The Incredibles in 2004.

					Bottom Line: The film will bring back the magic for your t(w)een, who was a fan of the original. But, it could be too intense for preschoolers. There are some spoilers below in the full review. Full Review: While it had some great songs, and I thought better instrumental music, I still like the music from the original better. The reprise of "Into the Unknown" at the end of the movie is sung by Panic! At the Disco - clearly meant to appeal to the original Frozen fans, who are now tweens and teens.
